# widget-standards

This project specifies the design and technical standards for building widgets for project HUD.

## Getting Started

Each widget is its own entity which runs totally independantly from the main HUD project. 

To be able to test widgets it recomended to use [@serby](https://github.com/serby)'s [Yonder](https://github.com/serby/yonder) however this 
is currently not working for the latest release of express so a fork is available [here](https://github.com/serby/yonder).
